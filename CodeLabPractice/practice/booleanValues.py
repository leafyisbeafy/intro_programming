# Definition:
# Boolean values are a data type that can have only two possible values: True or False.

# Usage in conditional statements:
# Boolean expressions are used in if statements to control the flow of a program. For example, in the nested if statements shown for customer discounts, Boolean expressions determine which code block is executed.

# Comparison operators:
# While not explicitly shown in these images, comparison operators like ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >= are used to create Boolean expressions.
#
# if invoice_total < 100:
#     discount_percent = 0
#
# Logical operators:
# AND, OR, and NOT are logical operators used to combine or modify Boolean expressions. These are briefly mentioned in earlier images we saw.
#
# is_valid = True
#
# Boolean in loops:
# In the last image (pages 84-85), we see Boolean expressions used in while loops:
#
#     while choice.lower() == "y":

# Boolean values are usually the result of comparison or logical expressions.
#
# is_valid = (5 > 3)  # True
# is_invalid = (5 < 3)  # False
#
# Boolean values in control structures like if statements.
#
# is_authenticated = True
# if is_authenticated:
#     print("Access granted.")
# else:
#     print("Access denied.")
#
# Logical operators: These allow you to combine multiple Boolean expressions.
#
# and: Returns True if both expressions are True.
# or: Returns True if at least one expression is True.
# not: Inverts the Boolean value.
#
# age = 21
# has_id = True
# can_enter = (age >= 18 and has_id)  # True
# print(can_enter)
